# 💻🔓 Ethical Hacking

Welcome to the Ethical Hacking repository! This repository is dedicated to the practice and study of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and cybersecurity research. Here, you will find a collection of projects, tools, and resources aimed at educating and enhancing skills in the field of ethical hacking.

## 🔧 Projects

### 💥 Ethical Hacking Course (MSc in Cybersecurity, LM-66, Sapienza) 💥

This subfolder contains all materials related to the Ethical Hacking exam conducted at Sapienza University. The exam consists of two phases: designing a vulnerable VM and conducting penetration testing on a VM created by another team.

#### Vulnerable Virtual Machine ⚠️

This subfolder contains a custom-designed vulnerable virtual machine (VM) created by our team as part of the Ethical Hacking exam. The team members are Simone Ciferri (me), Matteo Concutelli, Giorgio Pesce and Adele Mussari. The VM is intentionally configured with various vulnerabilities to simulate real-world scenarios, providing a hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting security weaknesses.

#### Pentesting Reports 💣

This subfolder includes our penetration testing report. As part of the Ethical Hacking exam, we performed penetration testing on a VM designed by another team. Here, we document our findings, methodologies, and tools used during the testing phase. This section aims to provide insights into the practical application of ethical hacking techniques and methodologies.

## 📈 Future Projects

Stay tuned for more exciting projects! I plan to add more subfolders with different ethical hacking challenges and tools to help you expand your knowledge and expertise in cybersecurity.

## ❗Disclaimer

All resources in this repository are for educational purposes only. Use the provided tools and machines responsibly and only in environments where you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized hacking or penetration testing is illegal and unethical.

Happy Hacking!
