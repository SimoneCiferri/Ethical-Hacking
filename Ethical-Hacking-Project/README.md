# ðŸ’¥ Ethical Hacking Project (MSc in Cybersecurity, LM-66, Sapienza) ðŸ’¥

This project was part of the Ethical Hacking course at Sapienza University. The project was divided into two phases: designing a vulnerable virtual machine (VM) and performing penetration testing on a VM created by another team.

## Phase 1: Design a Vulnerable Virtual Machine

In this phase, we designed and implemented a custom vulnerable virtual machine (VM) based on **Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS 64-bit**. The VM is intentionally configured with various vulnerabilities to simulate real-world scenarios, providing a hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting security weaknesses.

The VM is available for download from Google Drive:

### Phase 2: Penetration Testing

In this phase, we performed penetration testing on a VM designed by another team. This section includes our penetration testing report, documenting our findings, methodologies, and tools used during the testing phase.
